# Setting Up Development Environment

## Web Client 

This tutorial assumes that you have fulfilled the following pre-requisites:
- Node.js version 12.2.0 or higher installed on your machine

```init
cd client
```
```init
npm install
```
```init
npm run dev
```

That should be sufficient. After running ``npm run dev``, you should see the following on your screen:

```
$ npm run dev
npm WARN config global `--global`, `--local` are deprecated. Use `--location=global` instead.
